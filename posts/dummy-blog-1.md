# How creating a perfect product scope helps build a perfect product

A simple roadmap to the process of product scoping which you can easily incorporate in your organizationâ€™s workflow

```js:timeout.js
 // Before: only React events were batched.
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount(c => c + 1);
          setFlag(f => !f);
          // React will render twice, once for each state update (no batching)
        }, 1000);

        // After: updates inside of timeouts, promises,
        // native event handlers or any other event are batched.
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount(c => c + 1);
          setFlag(f => !f);
          // React will only re-render once at the end (that's batching!)
        }, 1000);
```

Inside getStaticProps, you do not need to specify revalidate to use on-demand revalidation. If revalidate is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of false (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when unstable_revalidate() is called.

Incremental Static Regeneration works for any providers supporting the Next.js Build API (next build). Starting today when deployed to Vercel, on-demand revalidation propagates globally in ~300ms when pushing pages to the edge.

View our demo to see on-demand revalidation in action and provide feedback. Svix (enterprise-ready webhooks) and Clerk (authentication) have also created a demo of on-demand ISR.
