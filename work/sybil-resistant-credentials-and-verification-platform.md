# Our Process

**Discovery Phase**

<p>During this phase, we use the information gathered in the discovery phase to define the product's features, requirements, and goals. We take a user-centered approach to scope, focusing on the needs and desires of the end users.</p>

<p>We also consider the technical requirements of the product, such as the technology stack, scalability, and security.</p>

**Planning Phase**

<p>Once we have defined the product scope and MVP, we move on to the planning phase. During this phase, we create a roadmap for the product's development.</p>

<p>This roadmap outlines the development milestones, the timeline for each milestone, and the resources needed to achieve them. The roadmap is designed to ensure that the development process is efficient and cost-effective.</p>
